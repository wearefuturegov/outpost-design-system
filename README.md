## /packages/outpost--docs

The one that brings it all together

## /packages/outpost--primitives

This package contains a bunch of json files and assets to be exported and imported into all the other packages.

As a bonus it also includes a storybook with a docsPage detailing all the information to be imported into the mega storybook - to make our lives easier!

### Contents:

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/) page
- [Design tokens](<https://www.figma.com/file/tVVtW6tHgghun8aY261M5z/Outpost-platform-(and-Scout-etc)?node-id=102%3A998>)

### TODO

- [ ] export `custom-viewports.js` file from here and use in the other storybooks

---

## /packages/outpost--css

Contains all the UI/UX and static views for the components, if you're needing plain HTML for components you'd go here.

### Contents:

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Create a New React App ‚Äì React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) as a necessity to get storybook to behave!

### TODO

- [ ] export the css

---

## /packages/outpost--react

### Contents:

- [Create a New React App ‚Äì React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) as a necessity to get storybook to behave!

### TODO

### How tos

#### Create a new package

Dont for get to add it to the `package.json` under `workspaces` at the top of this repo.

```sh
mkdir outpost--x
cd outpost--x
yarn init
```

This will create a new storybook setup for basic html

```sh
npx sb init --type html
```

If you need javascript

```sh
npx create-react-app outpost--x
cd outpost--x
npx sb init --type react
```

#### Testing

WIP but my current thinking is that since the `outpost--css` package contains the css and a 'template.html' that we could keep the `semantic` `ui`, `ux` and any `accessibilty` tests in there.

Tests in `outpost--css` would be things like:

- the default top level component is a `div` with the classes `x`, `y` and `z` and the child nodes ones are `a`, `b`, `c`
- is this accessible in all its states
- what are all the possible options for this component

The tests defined in `outpost-css` should be able to run over every other library, meaning all we need to do is find a way to setup core interaction tests that we run over each version

**Pros**

- we can be super prescriptive about which selectors we're using, eg you must use h1 with this component
- keeping the tests in `outpost--css` means we can rapidly prototype and test, all html and nothing fancy

**Cons**

- there is no javascript in `outpost--css`, the html components are just there for validation.

### TODO's

- [ ] Export everything to npm packages!
- [ ] Linting
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Theres a few storybook errors that have been copied accross while putting this together
- [ ] Need to make sure each storybook is standardised!
- [ ] get tmux script to load docs last
- [ ] setup allll the chromatics!
